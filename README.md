# TripWeather

![Playstore banner](playstore/banner.png)

An Android app for viewing weather conditions along a road trip, available on
the [Google
Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.faudroids.tripweather).


## Setup

To successfully compile the app you will need to supply a number of API keys as part of the string resources. They are
- ```google_maps_key``` required to show the [Google Map](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#getting_the_google_maps_android_api_v2)
- ```google_places_key``` used for showing autocomplete for locations ([Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/documentation/))
- ```open_weather_map``` required to get weather forecasts from [openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org/api)

## The Android Challenge

This app is part of the [Android Challenge](http://faudroids.org/challenge),
where we, a [small team of students](http://faudroids.org/team/) who are
passionate about Android programming, are building one Android app every month
for one year. TripWeather is our app for February.


## Feedback

TripWeather is far from perfect nor is it meant to be a finished product (one
month just isn't enough). For us the Android Challenge is more about
prototyping apps quickly to see if an idea could work. So if you have found
TripWeather useful or like the idea, don't hesitate to [drop us a
note](http://faudroids.org/contact). Of course you can also directly send us a
pull request with the feature you would like to see!
